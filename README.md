# fe-interview-test-angular
Eco-Mind Prospective Hire Test - Angular Edition
=================================================


Project Overview
----------------

This is a web application for simple department management.


Your Tasks
----------
In the welcome-page, you'll find a list of task and bug that you can resolve or complete. It's not needed to complete all but only that you prefer.


You may use any IDE or text editor you are comfortable with. You are encouraged to add any open source third-party
library that you feel makes your task easier. You may make any structural changes to the project that you see fit.


Evaluation Criteria
-------------------

1. Correctness of solution

   Naturally, the project you submit must be functional. You will also be evaluated on *how* your solution addresses the
   assigned tasks.

2. Platform knowledge

   Does your code demonstrate your knowledge of the capabilities of the Angular framework and its resources?

3. Coding style

   Is your coding style neat? Does it fit in with the prevailing style of the project? Is it idiomatic such that it will
   be easily understood by other Angular developers? Is it adequately (but not excessively) commented?

4. Working with git

   Good git usage is important for collaborating with other developers. Make sure each change is logically distinct (
   i.e. don't combine unrelated changes into a single "mega" commit). Make sure the commit message for each change is
   meaningful.

Submitting Your Code For Evaluation
-----------------------------------

When you are finished and ready to submit your work, use the following command to generate a series of patch files with
all of your changes:

    git format-patch origin/main

This will create one or more numbered patch files.
